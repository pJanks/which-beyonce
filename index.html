          <span class="description">To begin playing, the player whose name is highlighted can click any card in the card pile. It will flip over and reveal a picture of Beyonc&eacute;. Click another card. If they match, they will disappear and you will have completed a match! If they don't, you'll have three seconds to look at them before they flip back over. Then it's time for the other player to try!</span>
          <span class="description">After you play, you'll see the name of the final winner and how long it took to win the game.</span></p>
